# Time-Series-Forecasting-on-Stock-Data

Time Series Forecasting Project focused on JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. (Ticker: JPM), one of America's top 50 companies. Analyzing stock data from 2018 to the present, the study uncovered a stable pricing trend with a tight Inter-Quartile Range of 110-140 for the Close column. Notably, the Adjusted Close variable exhibited significant variation relative to trading volume, highlighting the influence of market activity on stock prices. 

The analysis employed advanced techniques such as the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model to capture seasonality and forecast trends. Despite the non-stationarity of the data, transformations like the Box-Cox transform and differencing were applied, ensuring model accuracy. Comparative assessments favored the ARIMA model over Holt Winter's Multiplicative method, showcasing its prowess in minimizing Root-Mean-Squared-Error and improving Mean Absolute Percentage Error. This project contributes valuable insights to financial forecasting, emphasizing the role of data science in decoding intricate stock market patterns.
